# AirBnB Clone
This project is an AirBnB clone implemented in Python. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) for managing AirBnB objects and serves as the first step towards building a full web application.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a command interpreter that allows users to perform various operations on AirBnB objects. These operations include creating new objects, retrieving objects from storage, performing operations on objects, updating object attributes, and destroying objects.

## Features

Create new objects: Users can create new instances of objects such as User, State, City, Place, etc.

Retrieve objects: Objects can be retrieved from storage, allowing users to view existing data within the AirBnB system.

Perform operations on objects: Users can perform various operations on objects, such as counting, computing statistics, and more.

Update attributes: Users can update the attributes or properties of an object, enabling data modification within the AirBnB system.

Destroy objects: Objects can be deleted from the system, allowing for the removal of unwanted entries.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone <https://github.com/your-username/airbnb-clone.git>

Change into the project directory:

cd airbnb-clone

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To start the command interpreter, run the following command:

python console.py

Once the command interpreter is running, you can enter commands to perform various operations on AirBnB objects.

## Testing

To run unit tests, use the following command:

python3 -m unittest discover tests

## Acknowledgements

This project was developed as part of the ALX Africa software engineering program.

Special thanks to the peers and mentors for their guidance and support.

## Conclusion

This AirBnB clone project provides a command-line interface for managing AirBnB objects. It serves as a foundation for building a full web application with features such as HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end development.

Thank you for using our AirBnB clone!
